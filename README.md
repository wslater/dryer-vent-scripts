# Dryer Vent Opportunity Analysis Tool

This script generates a list of ZIP codes within a 30-minute driving area from Morrisville, NC, and ranks them based on an "Adjusted Opportunity Score" ‚Äî calculated as:

```
Adjusted Opportunity Score = Total_Single_Family_Homes √ó Median_Household_Income
```

It combines shapefile data, housing data from the U.S. Census, and real-time API access to income estimates by ZIP code.
